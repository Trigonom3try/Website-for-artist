		<h3>1. Objective</h3>
		<p>
			The objective of this project is to create 2-dimensional 
			"Sprite" image objects for use in various web- and non web-based
			interactive video games.
		</p>
	</div>
		<h3>2. Your First Assignment</h3>
		<p>
			Your first assignment is to choose one of the following subjects
		to draw (please note that this is just the tryout phase, and if you 
		decide to stay on for the project you will ultimately have to do both) :
		</p>
    <div class="grid">
      <div id="Ashigaru">
        <h4>Ashigaru</h4>
        <h5>"Peasant/Footsoldier" </h5>
      
      </div>
      <div id="Geisha">
        <h4>Geisha</h4>
        <h5>"Consort/Assassin"</h5>
        
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibAdi-q_EHA" target="_blank">Watch this video for additional characterization of the Geisha</a>
      </div> 
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <h3>The Style</h3>
      <p>The style of your sprite should resemble classic 8bit art such as the following :</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid">
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>I'm also looking to preserve a cartoonish element, similar to that seen in Overwatch sprays, with oversized head and overly expressive features : </p>
    </div>

    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>3. The Sprite Editor</h3>
      <p>The tool that you will be needed to use to create your sprites will be a piece of proprietary software, written in Java, the SpriteEditor_v1.0. You will need to use this tool because the games which will employ the sprites, such as they are, can only read files of the format created by the Editor.  The Editor itself should be self-explanatory enough to use, with sliders to create custom colors plus a pre-made pallette of default colors, as well as the ability to use different brushes, customize your brush, and draw lines, circles, and rectangles. Each sprite for this particular project will be 60 pixels x 60 pixels. Sprites are saved into and loaded from text files. Saved files will appear in the same directory as the code for the editor; likewise, in order to load a file, it must be in the same directory. It is important that you do not try to edit these files in any way (I mean, they contain your drawings, so you wouldn't want to anyway). When you finish a sprite, you can email the text file to <span>lemongrab6000@gmail.com.<span></p>
      <p>To run the Editor, you can either:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Click on the link to download the .class file; Compile and run the file from the Windows command line</li>
        <li>Click on the link to download the .txt file; rename the file with extension .class; compile and run from the Windows command line</li>
        <li>Copy and paste the source code (do not edit unless you know what you're doing!) included below into a .txt file; rename the file with extension .class; compile and run the file from the Windows command line</ol>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>4. Payment</h3>
      <p>You will be paid <span3>$5.00 USD</span3> per drawing (this will go up if/when you get to the more interesting drawing/s). Payment will be through the app Venmo: add me @FreeMind-studios and request payment (or, we can potentially do PayPal but Venmo is easier)</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>5. Contact</h3>
      <p>You can contact me for any questions, or if you need help with the editor, or any problems or bugs that you find with the editor, or anything that you want the editor to be able to do to make your job easier, or for anything else, through the <span5>Message Channel</span5> below, through <span6>Twitch</span6>, or at my email address: <span>lemongrab6000@gmail.com<span> </p>
